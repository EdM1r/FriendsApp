# Friends App


This is my first rails project. Done via YouTube tutorial at freeCodeBootcamp: https://youtu.be/fmyvWz5TUWg


This application is available at Heroku: https://friends-app-by-ed.herokuapp.com


The application allows you to create list of your friends. You friends will be only visible to you. You will need to sign up, then you can start to add friends.
